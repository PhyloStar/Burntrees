Check new tree formats (scientific etc) in BEAST and MrBayes 3.2!

Can't handle taxon names within single quotes due to the regexpr '\b', "word boundry"?! Should be changed to "\b | '" or similar.

Warn if jump == 0

Warn if jump > trees in file(+/- 1?)

See if it's possible with a while @ARGV for reading several files ?

Need to resetcounters whenever there is a new file ?

Use --concatenate flag

If several files, use --burnins=10,10,10 ?

Check burnins (check if @burnins are several) ?
